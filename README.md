Trading Strategy Evaluation
This project focuses on evaluating various trading strategies using stochastic market simulation. It provides an analysis of different trading strategies and their performance metrics such as profitable trades, max drawdown, sharpe ratio, and resilience index.

Prerequisites
To run this code, you need the following libraries:

NumPy
Pandas
You can install these libraries using pip:
pip install numpy pandas
How It Works
The code consists of several functions and a main function that orchestrates the simulation and evaluation process. Here's an overview of the key components:

simulate_market(prices, noise_level, days): This function simulates a stochastic market by generating random returns based on the historical price data. It returns simulated prices for the given number of days.

resilience_index(profitable_trades, max_drawdown, sharpe_ratio): This function calculates the resilience index, which combines multiple performance metrics to assess the effectiveness of a trading strategy.

moving_average_crossover(prices, short_window, long_window): This function implements the moving average crossover strategy. It calculates short and long moving averages based on the price data and generates buy/sell signals accordingly.

mean_reversion(prices, window, threshold): This function implements the mean reversion strategy. It calculates the mean and standard deviation based on the price data and generates buy/sell signals when prices deviate from the mean by a certain threshold.

momentum(prices, window): This function implements the momentum strategy. It calculates returns and rolling mean based on the price data and generates buy/sell signals based on the momentum of returns.

trading_strategy(prices, strategy): This function acts as a wrapper that selects and executes a specific trading strategy based on the provided strategy name.

evaluate_trading_strategy(strategy_name, prices, noise_levels, num_simulations): This function evaluates a trading strategy by running simulations with different noise levels. It calculates profitable trades, max drawdown, sharpe ratio, and returns resilience indices for each noise level.

main(): The main function loads historical price data, defines noise levels, and runs the evaluation process for multiple trading strategies. It prints the results for each strategy.

Usage
Replace the placeholder historical price data with actual data in the prices array.

Adjust the noise_levels list based on your preferences or requirements.

Set the num_simulations variable to control the number of simulations to run for each noise level.

Modify the strategies list to include or exclude specific trading strategies you want to evaluate.

Run the code and observe the results printed for each strategy, including profitable trades, max drawdown, sharpe ratio, and resilience index.
